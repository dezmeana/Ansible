# Ansible
Basic Ansible scripts using cisco.ios.ios

Inside the ansible folder create a folder for collections mkdir ./collections I intially had issues with downloading cisco.ios.ios collections as my version of Ansible was borderline too old ensure you have a recent version running by entering ansible --version at the Cli with the clloections varible set in the .cfg and being located inside the ansible folder run 'ansible-galaxy collection install cisco.ios'
